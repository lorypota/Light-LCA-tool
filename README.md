# Light LCA Tool

The Light LCA (Life Cycle Assessment) Tool is an application designed to monitor the usage and environmental impact of specific assembly parts in product creation. Unlike the usual practice of conducting a complete study of components used in a product only at the end for issuing environmental impact certificates, this app provides a less precise but more general understanding throughout the production process.

## Purpose

The main goal of this application is to increase worker awareness about the environmental impact of using specific parts during product assembly, rather than just at the end. By providing real-time insights, the Light LCA Tool aims to encourage more environmentally conscious decisions throughout the production process.

## Technologies Used

- Sveltekit with TypeScript (frontend)
- Tailwind CSS (styling)
- MongoDB (database)
- Docker (containerization)
- Git (version control)

## Current Status

The Light LCA Tool is currently in development.
